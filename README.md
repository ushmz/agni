This is simple API server for original information retrieval system.

One of the research topic of our laboratory is interface design to make them aware of something important.
This API helps you to concentrate on developing your own interface.

## Requirements

- python (^3.6.7)
- docker
- [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate)

## Run

The first time you have to build container image with `build` subcommand, and create container with `up` subcommand.
You can do above procedure at once with `--build` option with `up` subcommand.

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose up
# or
docker compose up --build
```

Once you build container image, you can create container without `--build` option.

```sh
docker compose up
```

And once you create container with `up` command, you can start the services with `start` subcommand.

```sh
docker compose start
```

Now you can see API server in `localhost:8888`, and MySQL server in `localhost:3336`.

If you want run mysql service only, add service name as an argument.

```sh
docker compose start db
```


## Develop

In `/app` directory, there are dependency list files. (`pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`)

If you use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), run following command.

\* **Make sure you have compatible python environment. (^*3.6.7)**

```sh
poetry shell
poetry install
```

If not, install dependencies by using `requirements.txt` like

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
